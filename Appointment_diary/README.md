Appointment diary:

Create an appointment diary program that stores the date, exact time, place, name and a related note of events in "records". The program should be able to:

- create new records,
- modify the old ones,
- delete the old ones,
- for a calendar-like (chronological) listing of events related to a given day, week and month,
- search for an event by name,
- save and restore the database to a file.
